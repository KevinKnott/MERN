# MERN
Learning space for the MERN stack

To use this project you need to create the setup for config. This is used by Heroku later on in the development steps.

Currently it uses the following json:

{
    "mongoURI": "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@><cluster>.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority",
    "jwtSecret": "<some_security_token_here>" 
}
